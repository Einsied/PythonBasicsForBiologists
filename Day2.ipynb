    "\n",
    "Yesterday we discussed programming and computers in general. We used the example of Alice and Bob. To recall Bob was researching the growth of cancer-cells and alike counted them from him. She sent the results in comma-separated-value files.\n",
    "\n",
    "While were exploring the example we develop a simple algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "For every file we do the following:\n",
    "    1. We open the file \n",
    "    2. We figure out what day and dish it is \n",
    "    3. We create a counter for the number of cells \n",
    "    4. We create a counter for the area covered by the cells \n",
    "    5. We ignore the first line \n",
    "    6. For every line we do the following:\n",
    "        1. We increase the cell counter \n",
    "        2. We add the cell area to the cell-area counter \n",
    "    7. We save the cell-counter \n",
    "    8. We save the area counter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With this example in mind we learned that computers use **memory-cells** to store data and that we refer to these one or multiple of these cells with **variables**. We also learned that we change what is in this cells with **operators**, before approaching **functions** and executing our first line of python. \n",

    "This time you got a number without an ```.``` these are called integers. This should alarm you slightly. Why are there two **operators** that do almost the same thing? The answer is the way computer store data in their **memory-cells**. You may recall that they store data in binary as ```1``` and ```0```. So ```00000101``` corresponds to ```5``` in the decimal system. We introduced this as an example for how a number could be stored. In practice the [Two`s complement] (Two's complement - Wikipedia) is used, but the differences do not matter for us.\n",
    "As we discussed the content of **memory-cells** can be interpreted in different ways, we therefore assign every **variable** a **type**, so we know how interpret the data in the **memory-cell** the **variable** corresponds to. This means how we interpret the content of a **memory-cell** depends on the **type** of a **variable**.\n",
    "The way we introduced binary-numbers above they can only represent integers or natural numbers. In Python the **type** of integers is **int**. If we wish to represent floating-point-numbers we have to split our **memory-cell** into three different areas. The sign telling us if the number is positive or negative, the fraction telling us what comes behind the ```.``` and the exponent. To get our final floating-point-number or **float** we calculate:\n",
