    "Considering that we have now \"incorrect unit\" we have to create one, but how?\n",
    "The answer to this is simulation.\n",
    "Especially in Physics simulations are often used tool to answer questions that cannot be answered with simple experiments.\n",
    "If we want to know how galaxies form we can neither make one in our own backyard nor can we observe it in our lifetimes,\n",
    "so we build a mathematical model in a computer and investigate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In biology, computer simulations are more difficult to perform, because we lack a sufficiently advanced mathematical understanding of the problems we investigate.\n",
    "Expressed in a simpler way â€œit is easier to calculate how two galaxies collide, than how two cell interacts with each other.\n",
    "You can see this in the way we \"simulated\" the our two neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "We take a starting point and then roll a random number afterwards.\n",
    "Adding the random number to the last time gives us the new spike time.\n",
    "Thereby we have a randomly firing neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "We cover simulations, because I believe that during your career you will may encounter questions that can be answered by writing a short program and running it instead of using a plant or animal and that the use of simulation will slowly proliferate within biology.\n",
    "For the latter case always remember that a simulation is a simplified mathematical model and therefore flawed, so if you use it always ask which corners were cut and how this will influence your research.\n",

    "## Numerical differentiation\n",
    "\n",
    "After we have seen our two plots, it seems prudent to look at the growth rates now.\n",
    "As you may recall from your math studies the growth of the cells is the change in the number of cells or the first derivative of the numbers you see in front of you.\n",
    "Since we lack the underlying function, we have to solve this problem numerically,\n",
    "which means letting a computer handle it by a number-by-number basis.\n",
    "So how do we do this?\n",
    "\n",
    "During my high-school time the derivative was introduced via the [slope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope) of a function.\n",
    "We counted how much we went up or down on one axis comparted to the other,\n",
    "as shown in the following [illustration from Wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wiki_slope_in_2d.svg):\n",
    "\n",
    "![A slope illustrated with the interval steps on the x- and y-axis](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c1/Wiki_slope_in_2d.svg/445px-Wiki_slope_in_2d.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, for us [numerical differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_differentiation) did not progress much further, so we get the first derivative with the the original formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "m = \\frac{y_{2} - y_{1}}{x_{2} - x_{1}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So we can get the forward slope, an approximation for the first order derivative by looking .\n",
    "\n",
    "We can get the forward slope, an approximation for the derivative by looking a certain distance ahead.\n",
    "In our case, the sample times indicate the length of this distance often called h.\n",
    "Our formula now takes the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f^{'}(x) = \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need a symmetric derivative, you may choose to look around the point of interest and use:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f^{'}(x) = \\frac{f(x + h) - f(x - h)}{2 h}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Should you need to calculate derivatives of mathematical functions you should look up [Taylor expansion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series) and [finite difference coefficients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_coefficient).\n",
    "In this case you should also pay attention to the size of h.\n",
    "You can also reverse the process and numerically integrate, but there are special lectures for this topic that will warn you about the pitfalls in the different techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "To round up this topic I would ask you to calculate the derivatives of the cell growth and plot them. Please use the cell below."

    "A good example of this is [rubber duck debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging).\n",
    "It is especially useful for novice programmers as yourself or problems with many steps.\n",
    "The general idea is that explaining something requires you to think more deeply about it,\n",
    "therefore you can improve your understanding and by explaining.\n",
    "So, you need to explain your code to figure out why it does not do what it is supposed to.\n",
    "While a live human can contribute his or her own insights, a rubber duck is sufficient to gain your own.\n",
