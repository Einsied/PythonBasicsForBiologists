    "Last unit we learned about **operators** and data-**types**. **Operators** like ```+```, ```/``` or ```<```, allow us to work with **variables** containing different **values**. With the help of **lists** we van group **ints**, **floats**, **strs** and other data-**types** together.\n",

    "The combination of these allowed us to formulate most of the building blocks for our final algorithm.\n",

    "1. [x] We open the file ```csv_file = open(\"./data/Day_1_dish_1_zoom_3.csv\")```\n",
    "2. [x] We figure out what day and dish it is ```_, day, _ , dish_number, _, zoom_factor = csv_file_name.split(\"_\") ```\n",
    "3. [x] We create a counter for the number of cells ```cell_counter = 0``` \n",
    "4. [x] We create a counter for the area covered by the cells ```cell_area_counter = 0```\n",
    "5. [ ] We ignore the first line \n",
    "6. [ ] For every line we do the following:\n",
    "    1. [x] We increase the cell counter ```cell_counter += 1```\n",
    "    2. [x] We add the cell area to the cell-area counter ```cell_area_counter += cell_area```\n",

So if we write ```small_numbers = range(0, 10, 1)``` we get all number beginning from ```0``` to ```9```. So ```end``` is not included in the range. \n",
    "This may seem weird, but can be attributed to the way **lists** work. Since **lists** start at ```0``` a list with 10 elements is indexed by ```0```, ```1```, ```2```, ```3```, ```4```, ```5```, ```6```, ```7```, ```8``` and ```9``` or ```range(0, 10, 1)```. \n",
