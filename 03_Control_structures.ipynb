    "Last unit we learned about **operators** and data-**types**. **Operators** like ```+```, ```/``` or ```<```, allow us to work with **variables** containing different **values**. With the help of **lists** we van group **ints**, **floats**, **strs** and other data-**types** together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of these allowed us to formulate most of the building blocks for our final algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [x] We open the file ```csv_file = open(\"./data/Day_1_dish_1_zoom_3.csv\")```\n",
    "2. [x] We figure out what day and dish it is ```_, day, _ , dish_number, _, zoom_factor = csv_file_name.split(\"_\") ```\n",
    "3. [x] We create a counter for the number of cells ```cell_counter = 0``` \n",
    "4. [x] We create a counter for the area covered by the cells ```cell_area_counter = 0```\n",
    "5. [ ] We ignore the first line \n",

    "    1. [x] We increase the cell counter ```cell_counter += 1```\n",
    "    2. [x] We add the cell area to the cell-area counter ```cell_area_counter += cell_area```\n",
    "7. [x] We save the cell-counter ```cell_counter_dish_1_list.append(cell_counter)```\n",

    "To fill out the missing gaps and solve Bobs-cell-counting problem we also have to recall the the first unit. In the first unit we used ```if_less``` and ```goto``` to jump around in our pseudo-assembly-code. We now want to learn how this is done in Python."
