    "## Readable code\n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing functions has made our code already more reader friendly.\n",
    "However you may have noticed that there are still same questions left unanswered\n",
    "and some methods that make the solution more friendly to the reader we did not discusse yet.\n",
    "This is the reason why we will now talk about **Readability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Readability** refers to the ability of a reader to understand the text/code.\n",
    "As a general rule if the reader takes more than half the time to read your text than you needed to write it you goofed.\n",
    "If they take the same time to read it as you to write you should seriously consider professionalizing your writing style.\n",
    "\n",
    "I mention this because academia has a relevant fraction of fully self-taught-\"programmers\", believing hard-work is required to understand code.\n",
    "They usually conclude that whoever fails to understand their incoherent excuse for code \"just cannot program\".\n",
    "Industrial and trained wisdom usually attributes a failure to understand code to incomplete documentation or lack of \"domain-knowledge\",\n",
    "instead of programming skill. \"Domain-knowledge\" refers to knowledge about the subject, like cancer-cells, astrophysics or neuroscience.\n",
    "So in other words if someone fails to understand your code the following explanations are seen as legitimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tThey do not understand the area the code is applied in (e.g. they do not know what cancer-cells are)\n",
    "2.\tThey do not know basic language structures (e.g. for-loop)\n",
    "3.\tThe code is not written well enough (It is usually this)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please remember this if people ask you how your code works.\n",
    "It usually means you failed to explain your goal and methods well enough. \n",
    "So how do you make your code more readable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use clear **variable** and **function** names. So your cell-area should be called ```cell_area``` and not ```car```.\n",
    "- Try to write simple lines. One line should ideally do one to three things if it does more split it.\n",
    "- Use intermediate values. So if you add a few numbers before another step introduce a **variable** storing the sum.\n",
    "- Keep your functions short, they should fit on a small laptop screen.\n",
    "- Use comments or [docstrings](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) for functions to explain, what goes in,\n",
    "      what goes out and what the function should achieve.\n",
    "- Use comments in the code to explain why things are done a certain way.\n",
    "- Use comments in the code to reference to papers or online sources you read to understand the code.\n",
    "- Use comments in the code to introduce concepts that might be novel to another programmer.\n",
    "- Use a [sytleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) once once you start a bigger project.\n",
    "- Avoid writing [unmaintanable code](https://github.com/Droogans/unmaintainable-code).\n",
    "\n",
    "If your code starts reading like a paper with references to different web-resources and additional explanations you are doing things mostly right.\n",
    "JupyterNotebook is designed to support this approach, known as [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please take your solution and add the comments to it.\n",
    "Then let someone else read the code, so they can tell you what is not fully clear to them.\n",
    "If they claim to fully understand your code they are most probably to shy to critizize, so keep asking until they find a flaw."

    "## Looking at data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know how to make the code easy to read.\n",
    "This is good for us as programmers, but we are also scientists working with data, so we should discuss the datat too.\n",
    "What are data?\n",
    "Usually they are quantifiable observations or measurements,\n",
    "like the body-temperature of an animal or the number of times it pressed a button.\n",
    "So they are numbers.\n",
    "We have to present these numbers in a way, that they can be used in the program and understood by us and our peers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is means we have to learn how to look at our data, how to write them down.\n",
    "Usually the numbers belong together, like multiple temperature measurements of the same animal, in this case we could call this a [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(vector_space)).\n",
    "Dimension usually refers to something you can measure along, like time, temperature or button-presses.\n",
    "So they correspond to variables.\n",
    "Imagine a dimension as a [number line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line).\n",
    "On it goes everything an instrument produces, so if you have two thermometers you have two lines or two dimensions.\n",
    "If you have a clock this is another number line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everytime you take readings from your instruments you write down all this numbers, getting a data point.\n",
    "So if you read of a clock and a thermometer you get a temperature and a time on two axis, a temperature and a time axis.\n",
    "If you read fast enough your points start to form patterns, if you connect them you get lines or plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to compare two experiments or two things you lay the axes over each other.\n",
    "So you put the time and temperature axes of experiment 1 over those of experiment 2, giving you two overlapping plots.\n",
    "The question when two points truly belong on the same axis and are in the same dimension and when they are not depends on the question you ask,\n",
    "but the principle stays the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general we have to discriminate between continious data like temperature and discrete data like number of button presses.\n",
    "Discrete means that there are steps or boxes, so in our case we have unit 1, unit 2, unit 3 but no unit-2.23 and the units are therefore discrete.\n",
    "We only observed potentially interesting units in this case and filtered out most of the others.\n",
    "We also view our time as discrete despite it being continious, because we jump from one second to the other.\n",
    "This is a deliberate choice we made to get the spikes per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exercise please think about the units we want to analyze.\n",
    "How many dimensions do you find there and are they discrete or continuous.\n",
    "Please note your results in the next cell."

    "## Structuring data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have identified our dimensions, we can now begin to store them.\n",
    "Usually you can split your dimensions/variables into controlled and resulting.\n",
    "Controlled variables are the ones you or the experiment designer decides on, like the number of days or the number of dishes.\n",
    "Resulting variables are usually what we are interested in like total cell-area or cell-count.\n",
    "These are usually hypothesized to [depend]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables)  on the controlled ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you store your data you can rely on the fact, that there is a [countable]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set) and practical finite set of measurements.\n",
    "Countable means we can assign every measurement a number, so we can store them into a **list**.\n",
    "So the simplest way to store measurements is in **lists** sorted by the precise time or recording.\n",
    "This is usually not really helpful, so we return to the controlled variables and think about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we should store our data in a way we can access it by the controlled variables for easier access.\n",
    "So we store by unit and second.\n",
    "The seconds are contigious, meaning there are no gaps in our discrete numbers,\n",
    "therefore we can store them in **lists**.\n",
    "The uints are discontingious so we store them in sparse arrays or **dicts** instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly we have to deal with the immobility.\n",
    "It belongs to every second in every unit but only exists once, so we only use one list.\n",
    "For later evaluation we have to add it to every second in every unit.\n",
    "This is treated separatley, because it does not contain spike counts, so we end up with two tables,\n",
    "which we combined into one for convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we should think about how we should store the contents of the table.\n",
    "Here I would advocate for lists so we can iterate though them,\n",
    "the question is should we first select the unit and then the second or first the second and then the unit. \n",
    "The consideration here is what we will more likely access together, all data of one unit or all data of one second,\n",
    "since the units are physically separated and we want to investigate their spike counts,\n",
    "we may wish to see changes overtime meaning that the seconds should stay together.\n",
    "This means we will have a **dict** that contains the units and the units themselves are **lists** containing the values for the seconds.\n",
    "In code this would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "This may seem irrelevant at the moment because we changed nothingon the strucutre of our code.\n",
    "It becomes very relevant later however, when you deal with more complex data that not just slide into a convenient form.\n",
    "It is also faster in some languages to iterate along the lowest level of order, in our cause the seconds,\n",
    "because the **memory-cells** are neighbors,\n",
    "meaning they are fetched and read together."
