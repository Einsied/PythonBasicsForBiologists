So if we write ```small_numbers = range(0, 10, 1)``` we get all number beginning from ```0``` to ```9```. So ```end``` is not included in the range. \n",
    "This may seem weird, but can be attributed to the way **lists** work. Since **lists** start at ```0``` a list with 10 elements is indexed by ```0```, ```1```, ```2```, ```3```, ```4```, ```5```, ```6```, ```7```, ```8``` and ```9``` or ```range(0, 10, 1)```. \n",

    "## Functions\n",

So instead of ```sum = a + b``` we might write ```sum = add(a, b)```. \n",

    "```Python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "\tsum = a + b\n",
    "\treturn sum\n",
    "```\n",
    "As you can see a **function** looks quite similar to the other control-structures. It starts with the keyword ```def``` (like define) followed by the name of the **function**, ```(``` the **arguments** of the **function**, ```)```, ```:``` and an indented block of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the function is used to call it later so our example **function** is called ```add``` and can be called like ```c = add(2, 4)```. The **arguments** are what into a **function**, like food goes into your mouth or raw material into a factory. Often they are processed into a final product that is **returned**, but some functions do only modify their **mutable** inputs, like adding **values** to a **list**.\n",
    "Let us practice this by creating a new **function**. It will be the [fizz-buzz](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)-**function**. It is supposed to print either the number or “Fizz” if the number we put in is divisible by 3 and “Buzz” if it is divisible by 5. If both is the case it should print “Fizz Buzz”. This is a common test in programming interviews and a nice example. To test is something is divisible we use ```%``` which gives us the rest of a division.\n",
    "So let us begin with defining our **function**. Its name should obviously be “fizzBuzz” and its argument a number. So we write:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def fizzBuzz(number):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now we have to do something in it. Let us first get the rest of the division by ```3``` and print it out to test our function.\n",
