    "This may seem weird, but can be attributed to the way **lists** work. Since **lists** start at ```0``` a list with 10 elements is indexed by ```0```, ```1```, ```2```, ```3```, ```4```, ```5```, ```6```, ```7```, ```8``` and ```9``` or ```range(0, 10, 1)```. \n",

So instead of ```sum = a + b``` we might write ```sum = add(a, b)```. \n",

    "```Python\n",
    "def add(a, b):\n",
    "\tsum = a + b\n",
    "\treturn sum\n",

    "As you can see a **function** looks quite similar to the other control-structures. It starts with the keyword ```def``` (like define) followed by the name of the **function**, ```(``` the **arguments** of the **function**, ```)```, ```:``` and an indented block of instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name of the function is used to call it later so our example **function** is called ```add``` and can be called like ```c = add(2, 4)```. The **arguments** are what into a **function**, like food goes into your mouth or raw material into a factory. Often they are processed into a final product that is **returned**, but some functions do only modify their **mutable** inputs, like adding **values** to a **list**.\n",
    "Let us practice this by creating a new **function**. It will be the [fizz-buzz](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz)-**function**. It is supposed to print either the number or “Fizz” if the number we put in is divisible by 3 and “Buzz” if it is divisible by 5. If both is the case it should print “Fizz Buzz”. This is a common test in programming interviews and a nice example. To test is something is divisible we use ```%``` which gives us the rest of a division.\n",
    "So let us begin with defining our **function**. Its name should obviously be “fizzBuzz” and its argument a number. So we write:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def fizzBuzz(number):\n",

    "Now we have to do something in it. Let us first get the rest of the division by ```3``` and print it out to test our function.\n",

    "## Writing a program\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing a program consists of a few steps:\n",
    "1. **Design**: Here we figure out what our program needs and how it should run. We did this from unit one until now.\n",
    "2. **Skeleton/smallest parts**: You should always begin with a very small part that is easy to understand and write.\n",
    "3. **Test regularly**: As soon as you can run your code you should do so. This helps you to find mistakes while it is still small. Later you may wish to write [automated tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_automation) and expand into [test-driven-development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development).\n",
    "4. **Get feedback**: After you have written something ask another competent person to look at your solution, they might find mistakes you did not see.\n",
    "5. **Incremental improvement**: Do not try to solve your problem as a whole. Work **function** by **function**, **line** by **line**, otherwise you will be overwhelmed  and confused by your own work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Skeleton\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that all the building blocks are combined together we can return to our algorithm and fill out the missing steps:\n",
    "1. [x] For every file we do the following: ```for csv_file in csv_files:```\n",
    "    1. [x] We open the file ```csv_file = open(\"./data/Day_1_dish_1_zoom_3.csv\")```\n",
    "    2. [x] We figure out what day and dish it is ```_, day, _ , dish_number, _, zoom_factor = csv_file_name.split(\"_\") ```\n",
    "    3. [x] We create a counter for the number of cells ```cell_counter = 0``` \n",
    "    4. [x] We create a counter for the area covered by the cells ```cell_area_counter = 0```\n",
    "    5. [x] For every line we do the following ```for_line in csv_file_handle```:\n",
    "        1. [x] We ignore the first line ```if line_counter != 0```\n",
    "        2. [x] We increase the cell counter ```cell_counter += 1```\n",
    "        3. [x] We add the cell area to the cell-area counter ```cell_area_counter += cell_area```\n",
    "    7. [x] We save the cell-counter ```cell_counter_dish_1_list.append(cell_counter)```\n",
    "    8. [x] We save the area counter ```cell_area_counter_dish_1_list.append(cell_counter)```\n",

    "Now we have a working script analyzing one file. If you recall Bobs-cell-counting problem from the first unit, we expect him to have multiple files and arrange them into **lists**. First we should try to build the **lists** from the **dict** we already have. How we do this is a matter of style and taste, this means there are multiple ways with costs and benefits, the most relevant for you is **readability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Readability** refers to the ability of a reader to understand the text/code. As a general rule if the reader takes more than half the time to read your text than you needed to write it you goofed. If they take the same time to read it as you to write you should seriously consider professionalizing your writing style.\n",
    "\n",
    "I mention this because academia has a relevant fraction of fully self-taught-“programmers”, believing hard-work is required to understand code. They usually conclude that whoever fails to understand their incoherent excuse for code “just cannot program”. Industrial and trained wisdom usually attributes a failure to understand code to incomplete documentation or lack of “domain-knowledge”, instead of programming skill. “Domain-knowledge” refers to knowledge about the subject, like cancer-cells, astrophysics or neuroscience. So in other words if someone fails to understand your code the following explanations are seen as legitimate:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.\tThey do not understand the area the code is applied in (e.g. they do not know what cancer-cells are)\n",

    "3.\tThe code is not written well enough (It is usually this)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please remember this if people ask you how your code works. It usually means you failed to explain your goal and methods well enough. \n",
    "So how do you make your code more readable:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use clear **variable** and **function** names. So your cell-area should be called ```cell_area``` and not ```car```.\n",
    "- Try to write simple lines. One line should ideally do one to three things if it does more split it.\n",
    "- Use intermediate values. So if you add a few numbers before another step introduce a **variable** storing the sum.\n",
    "- Keep your functions short, they should fit on a small laptop screen.\n",
    "- Use comments or [docstrings](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/) for functions to explain, what goes in, what goes out and what the function should achieve.\n",
    "- Use comments in the code to explain why things are done a certain way.\n",
    "- Use comments in the code to reference to papers or online sources you read to understand the code.\n",
    "- Use comments in the code to introduce concepts that might be novel to another programmer.\n",
    "- Use a [sytleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) once once you start a bigger project.\n",
    "- Avoid writing[unmaintanable code](https://github.com/Droogans/unmaintainable-code).\n",
    "\n",
    "If your code starts reading like a paper with references to different web-resources and additional explanations you are doing things mostly right.\n",
    "JupyterNotebook is designed to support this approach, known as [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming).\n",
    "\n",
    "Please take your solution and add the comments to it. Then let someone else read the code, so they can tell you what is not fully clear to them. If they claim to fully understand your code they are most probably to shy to critizize, so keep asking until they find a flaw."

    "## Looking at data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we know how to make the code easy to read. This is good for us as programmers, but we are also scientists working with data, so we should discuss the datat too. What are data? Usually they are quantifiable observations or measurements, like the body-temperature of an animal or the number of times it pressed a button. So they are numbers. These numbers we have to present in a way, that they can be used in the program and understood by us and our peers.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is means we have to learn how to look at our data, how to write them down. Usually the numbers belong together, like multiple temperature measurements of the same animal, in this case we could call this a [dimension](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimension_(vector_space)). Dimension usually refers to something you can measure along, like time, temperature or button-presses. So they correspond to variables. Imagine a dimension as a [number line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_line). On it goes everything an instrument produces, so if you have two thermometers you have two lines or two dimensions. If you have a clock this is another number line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everytime you take readings from your instruments you write down all this numbers, getting a data point. So if you read of a clock and a thermometer you get a temperature and a time on two axis, a temperature and a time axis. If you read fast enough your points start to form patterns, if you connect them you get lines or plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to compare two experiments or two things you lay the axes over each other. So you put the time and temperature axes of experiment 1 over those of experiment 2, giving you two overlapping plots. The question when two points truly belong on the same axis and are in the same dimension and when they are not depends on the question you ask, but the principle stays the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general we have to discriminate between continious data like temperature and discrete data like number of button presses. Discrete means that there are steps or boxes, so in our case we have dish-1, dish-2, dish-3 but no dish-2.23 and the dishes are therefore discrete. The same is true for the number of cells as there can be no half or quater cell either there is a cell or there is none. Of yourse such a distinction becomes tricky if the cells start to divide, but these kind of problems you have to analyse yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an exercise please think about the cancer-cell-dishes Bob wants to analyze. How many dimensions do you find there and are they discrete or continuous. Please note your results in the next cell."

    "## Structuring data\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have identified our dimensions, we can now begin to store them. Usually you can split your dimensions/variables into controlled and resulting. Controlled variables are the ones you or the experiment designer decides on, like the number of days or the number of dishes. Resulting variables are usually what we are interested in like total cell-area or cell-count. These are usually hypothesized to [depend]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependent_and_independent_variables)  on the controlled ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you store your data you can rely on the fact, that there is a [countable]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countable_set) and practical finite set of measurements. Countable means we can assign every measurement a number, so we can store them into a **list**. So the simplest way to store measurements is in **lists** sorted by the precise time or recording. This is usually not really helpful, so we return to the controlled variables and think about them.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we should store our data in a way we can access it by the controlled variables for easier access. So we store by day and dish number. Since both are contigious, meaning there are no gaps in our discrete numbers, we can store both of them in **lists**. So we store our data in two dimensions day and dish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly we have to distinguish between the area and the cell-count. We currently do this by storing them in a **dict** with two entries. The fact that there are two entries means that we can understand the dict-entries as another dimension, so our data can be stored in a three dimensional structure. Which might similar to the next image from [wikipedia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Epsilontensor.svg/640px-Epsilontensor.svg.png).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Epsilon-tensor](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/71/Epsilontensor.svg/640px-Epsilontensor.svg.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case it would be just two tables stacked behind each other, corresponding to the area and the cell-count. We now have to ask ourselves how we should store this three dimensional data to keep it easily accessible . The obvious choice is to distinguish between cell-area and cell-count, but not so obvious is how we wish to distinguish. The simple approach is to use a **list**.\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "cells = [cell_area, cell_count]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The problem is obviously that ```cells[0]``` and ```cells[1]``` do not really tell us what we get, so we should use a **dict**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "cells = {\"area\": cell_area, \"cell_count\": cell_count}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now ```cells[\"area\"]``` and ```cells[\"count\"]``` are in my opinion much more readable than just numbers, so I think we should choose this option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we should think about how we should store the contents of the tables. Here I would advocate for lists so we can iterate though them, the question is should we first select the dish and then the day or first the day and then the dish. \n",
    "The consideration here is what we will more likely access together, all data of one dish or all data of one day, since the dishes are physically separated and Bob wants to investigate the growth, so we may wish to see changes overtime meaning that the contents of a dish should stay together. This means we will have a **list** that contains the dishes and the dishes themselves are **lists** containing the values for the days. In code this would look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Creation of the lists\n",
    "cells = {\n",
    "\t\"area\": [\n",
    "\t\t# Dish 1\n",
    "\t\t[ \n",

    "             #...\n",
    "\t\t],\n",
    "\t\t# Dish 2\n",
    "\t\t#....\n",
    "\t],\n",
    "\t\"count\": [\n",
    "\t\t# …\t\n",
    "\t]\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Accesing cell-count Dish 2 day 9\n",
    "# Remember lists start at 0\n",
    "cell_count = cells[\"count\"][1][8]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Please grab a piece of paper if you have one and write down some example data \"(dish, day):(area, count)\". Fill them out with numbers so dishes 1-3 and day 1-3. Now copy them once for area \"(dish, day):(area)\" and once for count \"(dish, day):(count)\". Lastly transfer them into tables with the dish as the major or vertical and the day as the minor or horizontal coordinate using glue and scissors is encouraged. Now put both tables behind each other, to visualize the data-structure we want to create."
