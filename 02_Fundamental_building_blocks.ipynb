    "    4. We create a counter for the area covered by the cells \n",

    "    6. For every line we do the following:\n",
    "        1. We increase the cell counter \n",
    "        2. We add the cell area to the cell-area counter \n",

    "This time you got a number without an ```.``` these are called integers. This should alarm you slightly. Why are there two **operators** that do almost the same thing? The answer is the way computer store data in their **memory-cells**. You may recall that they store data in binary as ```1``` and ```0```. So ```00000101``` corresponds to ```5``` in the decimal system. We introduced this as an example for how a number could be stored. In practice the [Two's complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) is used, but the differences do not matter for us.\n",
    "As we discussed the content of **memory-cells** can be interpreted in different ways, we therefore assign every **variable** a **type**, so we know how interpret the data in the **memory-cell** the **variable** corresponds to. This means how we interpret the content of a **memory-cell** depends on the **type** of a **variable**.\n",
    "The way we introduced binary-numbers above they can only represent integers or natural numbers. In Python the **type** of integers is **int**. If we wish to represent floating-point-numbers we have to split our **memory-cell** into three different areas.

To get our final floating-point-number or **float** we calculate:\n",

    "## Mutable types\n",
    "Python has more **types** than just **float** and **int**. Since you can introduce your own data **types** if you wish these are sorted into multiple [categories](https://python-basics-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/types/index.html).These categories help us understand which **operators** can be applied to which type and what they do, when we apply them. Besides this some **types** have other properties that influence how we use them. An important property is  **mutability**. \n",
    "\n",
    "A **variable** with a **mutable** **type** can be changed in-place. To better illustrate this let us introduce our first **mutable** the **list**.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **list** is something that contains different **values**.  If you recall Bobs problem from the first day of the course you may remember, that he had multiple petri dishes and wanted to investigate the growth of cancer-cells and therefore count the number of cells in each dish for twelve days. So for every dish we get 12 values representing the number of cells on every day, you could write them on a piece of paper and you would get a **list**. A **list** in Python works very similar, as shown in the following example:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Creating an already filled list\n",
    "# Like you write on your piece of paper the numbers are written into the []-brackets\n",
    "dish_1 = [12, 20, 43, 87, 172, 351, 721, 1404, 2900, 5832, 10915]\n",
    "# Appending a value to a list requires us to use \"append\", what append is we will discuss later\n",
    "dish_1.append(19983)\n",
    "# Removing an item from a list uses \"pop\". If we do not enter an int into pop, it removes the last item\n",
    "last_item_dish_1 = dish_1.pop()\n",
    "# Accessing a value in a list requires [], which are an operator on lists\n",
    "dish_1_day_3 = dish_1[2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The last line might be especially confusing, since the third day is accessed with the number ```2```. In many programming languages the first element is the zeroth element, if you wish to investigate the reasons you may want to read up on [C-Arrays](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/Pointers_and_arrays#Pointers_and_Arrays).\n",
    "Before we discuss **lists** in detail we should return to the concept of **mutable**. A **list** is **mutable**, so I can do things to it that change it without using the **assignment-operator** ```=```.  This not possible for **immutable** **types** like **float**. To better illustrate here are two code-samples:\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 1:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "a = 5.4\n",
    "a + 3.5\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Example 2:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "a = [0.0, 4.5, 8.3]\n",
    "a.pop()\n",
    "a.append(42.0)\n",
    "print(a)\n",

    "As you can see the **immutable** **float** cannot be changed, we can only use the **assignment-operator** to assign a new **value** to the **variable**. The **mutable** **list** can be changed without the use of the **assignment-operator**.  This has some interesting side-effects.\n",
    "Considering that I still stumble over the consequences of **mutable** and **immutable** sometimes I would like to take a detour. What do we mean when we write ```a = 4.0``` or ```a=[0,3,4]```. So far we translated it as “Write into a **variable** called ```a``` whatever is on the right-side of the ```=```-sign.” If we use pen and paper and have to copy a simple **float** we write it down on a new place on the paper, so we make a **copy**. This is how the **assignment-operator** works for **immutable** objects, it **copies** them. So when we write:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "cell_counter = 0\n",
    "cell_counter_copy = cell_counter\n",
    "```\n",
    "We end up with two **memory-cells** both containing the **value** ```0```.\n",
    "Now let us imagine we have to write something down, maybe a report or a paper. Similar to the case above we want to use **values** from a **list** with a few thousand entries. Do we **copy** them or do we write “see list no. X”? So do we spend half an hour typing, risking to introduce mistakes or do we **refer** to the original?\n",
    "\n",
    "The reasonable choice is most often the second. Python works the same way. When we write ```[12, 23, 35]``` we should read this as “Create a **list** containing the **values** ```12```, ```23``` and ```35``` and be a **reference** to this **list**.” This means that ```a = [12, 23, 35]``` should be read as “Name a **variable**/**memory-cell** ```a```, create a **list** containing the **values** ```12```, ```23``` and ```35``` and assign to the **variable** a **reference** to this **list**.”\n",
    "\n",
    "To abstract this behavior “**Mutables** are assign via a **reference** and are not **copied**.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that his is a very simplified view of what is going on and that the **mutable** concept in this form is rather unique to Python. Other languages differentiate very clearly between **values** and **references** often introducing the concept of constants. Should you decide to use other languages, remember the **memory-cells** and understand the concepts from there.\n",
    "\n",
    "So now we know that **mutable** **types** like list as stored and **assigned** as references. So let us go to a practical example:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "dish_1 = [12, 23, 35]\n",
    "dish_1_reference = dish_1\n",
    "dish_1_reference[1] = 42\n",
    "print(dish_1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Please attempt to predict what will be printed before you copy the code in the next-box and execute it.\n"
