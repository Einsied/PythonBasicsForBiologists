    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a Turing complete scripting language, this means it is a very useful tool to solve problems with logical algorithms.\n",
    "Simpler said it tells your computer how to crunch data or do computations for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are reading this you are most likely a biology student and wish to analyze a few data.\n",
    "This is what I intend to teach you here. In my personal experience the adoption of  programming languages is not hindered by the amount of “How to code”- literature.\n",
    "The internet is full of different sources that teach you how to code, what they do not teach you is how to think like the people that created the languages or tools you are using. This matters for **you** especially,\n",
    "because your training as biologists differs in some fundamental aspects from that of mathematicians, computer-scientists and physicists.\n",
    "These differences in training enable you to understand and investigate biological processes in a way that I could never, but they also hinder you in developing and utilizing *code*.\n",
    "For this reason I will focus more on the way of thinking than on syntax and libraries.\n",
    "Once you have understood the fundamental concepts you should be able to close the gaps using the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) and [tutorial[(https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me begin by quoting the first paragraph from the [official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language.\n",
    "> It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming.\n",
    "> Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "I assume this paragraph did not teach you much, which can be attributed to two gaps in your knowledge.\n",
    "The first gap is your vocabulary or your knowledge of definitions.\n",
    "This is knowledge that you can easily acquire by consulting textbooks or Wikipedia.\n",
    "I attempted to mark the terms that are stronger influenced by this here:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python is an easy to learn, powerful *programming language*.\n",
    "> It has *efficient* *high-level* *data structures* and a simple but effective approach to *object-oriented* programming.\n",
    "> Python’s elegant *syntax* and *dynamic typing*, together with its *interpreted* nature, make it an ideal language for *scripting* and rapid *application* development in many areas on most *platforms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "So understanding these terms is a hurdle, especially because most of the terms sound suspiciously familiar, like *efficient* for example.\n",
    "I doubt however that you measure efficiency in *operations* and *memory* consumption.\n",
    "The term *efficient* in this paragraph should be understood in these terms however, but as mentioned before this is not the major challenge.\n",
    "Let me highlight a two more words for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language.\n",
    "> It has efficient high-level data structures and a **simple** but effective approach to object-oriented programming.\n",
    "> Python’s **elegant** syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The terms here show the second gap in your knowledge, the way you approach, understand and interact with **problems**.\n",
    "For you a problem is probably a hurdle, an inconvenience, an obstacle, for me it is the fundament of scientific study.\n",
    "For me sciences consists of **problems** and **solutions**, these fit together like puzzle-pieces enabling us to understand and control the world.\n",
    "Only if you have both a **problem** and a **solution** can you publish, if you publish an observation you publish something you believe will help someone else to answer or **solve** a **problem**.\n",
    "So this person has a a **problem**, usually formulated as a question, and  you provide a **solution**.\n",
    "This question-answer-relationship is anchored rather deeply in computer-science, where you as the user want to achieve something, thereby defining a **problem** and then creating your **solution** based on the work of other software-developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose the previous example to show you the rather alien of thinking.\n",
    "It may seem familiar to you now, but unless you studied a mathematic related subject previously I assure you it is not.\n",
    "To stress this point let us discuss **simple** and **elegant**. \n",
    "What do they mean here?\n",
    "I would claim they refer to a very mathematical concept of perfection, which we may embody by the sentence: “Say precisely enough”.\n",
    "This means everything that needs to be said is said and anything else is not.\n",
    "This is often achieved by very few strict and solid definitions.\n",
    "Python for example was initially lauded for its rather small number of [reserved terms](https://docs.python.org/3.13/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords) and [built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html).\n",
    "It was considered **simple** and **elegant**, because it use **few** terms and combined them into a bigger system.\n",
    "It is **simple**, because it has **few** constituent parts and **elegant**, because they achieve the larger goal by their interaction.\n",
    "It is in the interaction of the objects, concepts and definitions that beauty can be found and is referred to here, but teaching a course on mathematic and logical aesthetics is beyond me so I will summarize with:\n",
    "It takes roughly 3 years to learn and you are fine hobbling along and ignoring it.\n",
    "What you can not ignore however is the way of thinking around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me [quote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) Donald Knuth a rather well known computer scientists on what makes a good programmer:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The psychological profiling [of a programmer] is mostly the ability to shift levels of abstraction, from low level to high level. To see something in the small and to see something in the large. \n",
    "\n",
    "What he refers to can be described as the ability to change perspective, to switch from a cellular few to the organ to the organism and to the entire ecosystem depending on the question asked and more importantly to stay quiet about the aspects that do not matter for the question. In other words to **say precisely enough**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way of thinking makes great engineers and physicists, as they are able to find the common characteristic for a brown bear, a moose and a sack of grain on the road.\n",
    "They all are an obstacle that slows down traffic.\n",
    "They all have a position on the road, which can be expressed by the distance along it.\n",
    "This information is sufficient to steer traffic away from it and therefore precisely enough for a road manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central mechanism they use to describe things are *equivalence*-classes.\n",
    "*Equivalence* means we can change entities in a context without anything changing.\n",
    "If some one is thirsty it does not matter if we hand them water or ice-tea, therefore water and ice tea are *equivalent* in the context of quenching thirst.\n",
    "Just like a 100 €-bill and a 10 €-bill are equivalent for buying one bag of flour.\n",
    "It does not matter which one you have it buys a bag of flour, at least until inflation ruins this example.\n",
    "An *equivalence*-class describes all things that are *equivalent* within a context.\n",
    "Since a brown bear, a moose and a sack of grain all block the road they are part of the same *equivalence*-class.\n",
    "\n",
    "So once it is clear what they share they also *decide* to perceive only the characteristics of things they deem relevant.\n",
    "So if something blocks the road they only need to know were to drive.\n",
    "Since the road is a long line they only need to know how far from the beginning of the road the obstacle is placed.\n",
    "The pitfall is already integrated in the example here:\n",
    "Removing a sack of grain and a living animal are two quite distinct tasks requiring distinct equipment.\n",
    "Note that they would not attempt to attach the nature of the obstacle to their description, but prefer to say something like “bear spray required for removal”, since while a bear always requires bear-spray there might be other obstacles that can be removed with bear-spray, so the “bear spray required for removal” is the larger *equivalence*-class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you may wonder why you were trained to think different, then answer is quite simple.\n",
    "This way of thinking makes quite poor observers. If you hand them a piece of paper and tell them to observe a rat for 30 minutes there is a good chance they wrote five sentences:\n",
    "“Rat walked to the far end of the cage.\n",
    "Rat walked to the center of the cage. Rat ran around the cage.\n",
    "Rat walked back to far end of the cage.\n",
    "Rat walked around the cage.”\n",
    "You know that is is a not “precisely enough”, but they will only know them after you begin asking them questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct use is of abstraction is next to a few fundamental mathematical concepts, used to abstract problems,\n",
    "the difference between a capable and an incapable programmer.\n",
    "The difference between endless despair and infinite levity, it is what I hope to demonstrate and teach you in this course."

    "## Real data\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to **learn** these skill is on a **practical example**.\n",
    "Therefore  we will work on data our group recorded during our research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group focuses how oxytocin, a neurohormone synthesized in the hypothalamus, influences maternal care.\n",
    "A major feature of mammalian maternal care is milk supply through the mammary gland.\n",
    "You may have already heard that oxytocin is secreted into the blood stream in the pituitary gland following suckling of the offspring.\n",
    "It elicits milk ejections by evoking contractions of smooth muscle cells in the mammary ducts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, oxytocin is not continuously secreted during suckling but released in bursts.\n",
    "This burst-like secretion is caused by bursts of oxytocin neural activity.\n",
    "We try to understand how this activity is generated, by investigating the behavior of rats and activity in their brains.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example we picked for you is the analysis of such neural activity with behavioral data.\n",
    "This data consists of extracellular spike (neuroscientists call action potential \"spikes\") recordings in which many cells have been recorded simultaneously, as well as pre-analyzed video-based behavioral data.\n",
    "The neural activity is recorded for units, which refer to neurons that act together.\n",
    "We analyzed the movement of the maternal animal, because it stops moving before milk ejection.\n",
    "We assume further that the oxytocin unit bursts during the milk ejection,\n",
    "so these two event should overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only one of the recorded units is a potential oxytocin unit.\n",
    "The final **goal** of the course will be to **find the oxytocin unit**,\n",
    "by identifying the characteristic firing pattern shown in the following image(B).\n",
    "\n",
    "![Sketch of the experiment and resulting plot](img/experiment.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Recording setup with an electrode that has many contacts along one [single shank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuropixels).\n",
    "B. Top: Maternal behavior (immobility vs. mobility).\n",
    "Bottom: Neural activity. Note that we see the spikes per second (Hz).\n",
    "We also see that there are seven distinct bursts measuring around 100 spikes per second.\n",
    "Also, note that the burst pattern seen here has been described to coincide with immobility.\n",
    "The combined investigation of both neural activity and behavior thus provides converging evidence that the recorded neuron is an oxytocin neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "![The action potential of a Oxytocin cell showing a burst with multiple spikes](img/OTburst.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of an oxytocin burst consisting of multiple spikes. You can see a large number of spikes in the center of the image."

    "\n",
    "If we consult the previous text, we learn we have to find bursts during phases of immobility.\n",
    "So we have to ask what is a burst?\n",
    "A burst is a high amount of spikes between two points in time.\n",
    "A physicist would call it a larger local maximum of the temporal density.\n",
    "A programmer would call it many spikes per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we want to look at all the seconds and see in which second are more spikes than usual.\n",
    "If we do it with pen and paper we would write a list with all the seconds from 1 to 3400 and make a tally list next to each second.\n",
    "Afterwards we would look for an unusual high number of [tally marks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tally_marks), as shown on the [wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Strike_symbol_(49778996432).jpg) image below.\n",

    "### Data representation and memory\n",
    "\n",
    "I talk about **data representation** or how computers “remember” things.\n",
    "You may have heard that computers are all “ones and zeros”.\n",
    "This refers to the way **memory** works in a computer.\n",
    "Remember the people that built them are always trying to find the simplest solution.\n",
    "So what is the most basic, simplest thing to remember?\n",
    "The answer they arrived at was truth.\n",
    "So the memory of a computer is based on an element called a **memory-cell** that is either filled or empty, “true” or “false”.\n",
    "Everything else is built from this cells.\n",
    "Your phone number, your program and the pictures on your phone are all saved in such cells.\n",
    "This is kind of a hassle, since it is difficult to figure out what which cell actually means.\n",
    "Therefore there are some **conventions** on **interpreting** them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The probably simplest thing to memorize after a True/False or **boolean** value is a **number**.\n",
    "You all know decimal numbers like “19”, “15” or “9”.\n",
    "If you recall your earlier education you should remember that the value of a number depends on the number and position of characters.\n",
    "So “19” means calculate 1 * 10 + 9 * 1.\n",
    "This becomes relevant because there are simpler system.\n",
    "If you wish to reduce the amount of characters to remember you can drow the \"9\" and read “15” as 1 * 9 + 5 * 1.\n",
    "You can continue this process until you are left with two characters “1” and “0”.\n",
    "In theory you could reduce further but then you no longer have an elegant way to write larger numbers.\n",
    "Since this system has only two characters is called binary.\n",
    "Now if you paid attention the cells have two states, “filled” and “empty” and we have two numbers “1” and “0”, we can therefore use them to write binary numbers like “1001”, which translates to 1 * (2 * 2 * 2) + 0 * (2 * 2) + 0 * (2) + 1 * 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "So a **computer** can saves numbers as **binary numbers** made up of ones and zeros.\n",
    "There is a wrinkle however.\n",
    "Since a computer is a real physical object int can only save a limited number of ones and zeros, so we have to squeeze multiple numbers in the same memory.\n",
    "How do we do this?\n",
    "Simple answer we write them behind each other and remember how long they are.\n",
    "It is convention to define the **length of a memory-cell as a power of 8**.\n",
    "So we have numbers that are 8 cells, 16 cells, 32 cells or 64 cells long. \n",
    "There are also longer numbers but they are uncommon.\n",
    "This way we can only store integers like 1, 2, 3 opposed to floating point numbers like 3.2 or 1.4, which will be discussed later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing 8 as the length of a **memory cell** has a few advatages, like its proximity to 10, the fact that 8 digits in binary correspond to two digits in hexadecimal numbers and that 8 is a power of 2, but these are not relevant now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering that this was a lot of rather dense information I would suggest you take a **break** and let the new information settle.\n",
    "Maybe you have same questions that appear later and you would like to have answered.\n",
    "Let us attend to them before we dive deeper into the inner workings of a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we learn how data like numbers are stored we should discuss how we operate on them.\n",
    "First we have to find our data-cells.\n",
    "To achieve this we need a easy way to give every cell a number or **enumerate them**.\n",
    "We call this number the **address** of the cell.\n",
    "Because giving every cell a number would give us a lot of numbers for all cells we combine them into addressable units.\n",
    "So if the addressable unit contains 64 memory-cells or **bits** it is a 64-bit architecture.\n",
    "If the unit contains only 32-bits then it is a 32-bit architecture.\n",
    "This is relevant if you need to use code from the last millennium, but for python it does not matter, opposed to the next step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have an address for every cell we can do a little magic.\n",
    "Since every cell can contain a number and an address is a number we can save addresses in cells.\n",
    "The cell containing the address is called a reference or a pointer, because it references or points at another cell.\n",
    "If we store a bunch of numbers behind the referenced memory-cell we can find them all with just one address and a second cell that tells us how many cells there are.\n",
    "However running around with a bunch of numbers is rather cumbersome, so we **give** our single or array of **memory-cells** a **name** like ```spike_counter```.\n",
    "This is called a **variable**. A **variable** is something that stands for something else. In computer-science always something that is saved in a memory-cell."

    "If we write ```1 + spike_counter``` we read it as “be ```1``` in addition to whatever is in the **memory_cell** called ```spike_counter```\".\n",
    "\n",
    "You may note that the **addition-operator** does not write anything to a **memory-cell**, it just stores the result temporarily,\n",

    "\n",
    "Now we know how data is stored and manipulated, but we did not yet talk about how a **computer knows what to do**, or how our algorithm is existing in the computer.\n",
    "As you can imagine it is connected to the **operators** we discussed earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you look at the algorithm we wrote before you may realize that is written line by line.\n",
    "This is a very simple and straightforward concept, so we may as well adopt it for storing the algorithm.\n",
    "So we create a **list** or **array** of **instructions** and follow them from top to bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises two questions **how** do we store instructions and **what** instructions do we store.\n",
    "Remember, the people that created this wanted few simple parts to build this language.\n",
    "So they decided to store the **instructions** as numbers in **memory-cells**,\n",
    "then they used one specific **memory-cell** to remember where in the list they were.\n",
    "This one is called the *program counter* or *instruction pointer*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding what **instructions** to store they chose the smallest possible one.\n",
    "The resulting **instruction**-set is called [assembly](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/X86_Assembly/GNU_assembly_syntax).\n",
    "We are not looking at it, because you will use it, but because it helps us to understand some concepts better,\n",
    "so instead of the real commands we will use a few **operators**.\n",
    "The first concept we gonna explore is the **atomic** **instruction**.\n",
    "**Atomic** means no longer divisible, so an **atomic instruction** or **atomic operation** is one that can not be split into smaller **instructions**.\n",
    "You can begin a long philosophical debate about which **instructions** should be **atomic** and which ones should not be, but this is pointless,\n",
    "because an **atomic instruction** is whatever the computer-chip-manufacturer built as an **atomic instruction** or your programming language defines as **atomic**. \n",
    "\n",
    "To solve the next exercises we will define a few **atomic instructions** in the form of **operators**.\n",
    "The new operator is the *goto*-operator.\n",
    "While it still exists in older programming languages like C++ it is already extinct in newer ones like python.\n",
    "Since I sincerely hope you will never have to use it outside of the following exercise,\n",
    "teaching you how computers deal with complex programs,\n",
    "we will simplify it as a “goto line” setting the program counter to a specific line. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you might have guessed the exercise includes going to different lines in a small code.\n",
    "If we do this always it is quite pointless, so we need a way to **control** how we move through the code.\n",
    "First something needs to be decided, so we introduce the ```<``` or  “lesser than”-operator.\n",
    "It is ```True```if whatever is on the left is smaller than the whatever is on the right.\n",
    "So ```4 < 5```is ```True``` and ```6<6```is ```False```. Next we are introducing a **keyword** that executes **instructions** if it is ```True```.  Then we combine them into an **operator** we call ```if_less```\n",
    "that executes the next line if whatever is first on its right is smaller than the second on the right. \n",
    "\n",
    "To better illustrate look at the next example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "spike_counter = 0\n",
    "if_less spike_counter, 2\n",
    "  spike_counter += 1 \n",
    "if_less cell_counter, 1\n",
    "  spike_counter += 1 \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So line by line:\n",
    "1. “A memory cell called ```spike_counter``` is set to the value ```0```”\n",
    "2. “Since the current value of ```spike_counter``` (```0```) is less than ```2```, execute  the next line”\n",
    "3. “Add to the memory-cell called ```spike_counter```the value ```1```\n",
    "4. . “Since the current value of ```spike_counter``` (```1```) is not less than ```1```, do not execute  the next line”\n",
    "5. Is not executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This after the last step ```spike_counter``` has a value of ```1```.\n",
    "Now let us take a look at the curated list you may need to solve the excersise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us summarize the **operators** this excersice is going to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator      | Example                  | Description                                                                        |\n",

    "| ```goto```    | ```goto 4```             | sets the *instruction-pointer* to the value on the right and continues from there  |\n",

    "we start again from the beginning.\n",
    "So we **loop** around. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is your turn, form groups of two or three and write some \"pseudo-assembly-code\", that\n",

    "Good, after this you know more about assembly than most programmers.\n",
    "So why did I pull you through this side-quest?\n",
    "First of all a  lot of people struggle with *multi-threading*, because they do not grasp the concept of **atomic instructions**, you now know what to google.\n",
    "Second you will encounter **functions** while you program and the concept of the *instruction-pointer* helps with understanding some of the more arcane ways to use them.\n",
    "Third you may read about **instruction**-pipelines being a bottleneck in modern central-processing-units.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us begin with the latter word-salad first.\n",
    "As you have learned all this instructions are just numbers in **memory-cells**, which tell a chip what to do. The challenge comes once you realize just how many numbers there are and how long it takes to move the content form a **memory-cell** on your hard-drive or in your *random-access-memory* to your chip.\n",
    "If you are interested feel free to read about [memory-latency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_latency), but I advise you not to bother that much.\n",
    "Short summary: “You can not have all the instructions on the chip and you do not want to fetch a new one every time, so you order a package.”\n",
    "This package then goes into an **instruction** -pipeline, but if there are a lot of ```if``` or ```goto```like **instructions** in it most of the stuff in the pipeline is useless and the central-processing-unit has to wait for new **instructions** thereby loosing time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now to the major point **functions**. To recall: “Our **instructions** are written in a list.\n",
    "We execute the **instruction** referred to by the *instruction-pointer*.\n",
    "We have an **instruction** to move the *instruction-pointer* to an arbitrary point in the list.”\n",
    "So what you may not see yet is that we can use ```goto```to move freely through the code and thereby reuse it.\n",
    "Just like with a “chose-your-own-adventure”-book we can separate our program into chapters, where every chapter is responsible for something we want to do and then just select the chapters.\n",
    "This is essentially the purpose of **functions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This does not really justify the cost of learning this until you realize you can write ```goto a```, setting the *instruction-pointer* to ```a```.\n",
    "This means your code can decide which **function** to run based on the value of a **variable** or to say it with other words a **variable** can be a **function**.\n",
    "This may seem minor at the moment but it is a powerful concept used in more advanced programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what should you remember from this little excursion:\n",
    "- There are **atomic operations** from which everything else is built\n",
    "- There are methods to control what is executed like ```if```\n",
    "- There are **functions**, that contain code that can be reused\n",

    "Most often they are combined however.\n",
    "\"Numpy\" for example is used in Python for fast calculations but is written in a **compiled** programming language.\n",
    "The reason for this difference is the time both **interpreter** and **compiler** get to process your text.\n",
    "The **interpreter** has to send **instructions** now so the central-processing-unit does not idle and should not waste the central-processing-units time by processing your text.\n",
    "For the **compiler** it is the other way round, it has all the time in the world to process your text and find a faster way to run it later.\n",
    "This means **compilers** often have special options to create faster programs.\n",
    "**Interpreters** do something similar, were they attempt to optimize during runtime,\n",
    "but a program will usually be slower if it is executed in a **interpreter** than in a **compiler**,\n",
    "assuming it was reasonable optimized to run on both. \n",
    "\n",
    "So what you want is to use an **interpreted** programming language like Python to evaluate your experiments and make your plots,\n",
    "while a specialists develops optimized code to handle the more general tasks.\n",
    "To achieve this you have to use their work, which in Python is delivered to you in modules, but more about those in a few days."

    "#### Random access memory\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you are biologists you already know reality is never as simple as the model.\n",
    "Here your attention to details may help you remember somethings that programmers often forget.\n",
    "Unfortunately it will not matter that much for most of your problems.\n",
    "As mentioned in the instruction-section the central-processing-unit that does all our calculation has a rather small memory.\n",
    "Imagine it like a clipboard were you only carry what you really need, while the majority of the data lies in a library.\n",
    "Do not think central university library here, but rather a small room filled with folders and books.\n",
    "This is the random access-memory or **RAM** if you need something you stand up go there and put it on your clipboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you were ever forced to work with paper you know that one never takes only one paper,\n",
    "usually a folder or book is taken and placed on the desk and then put on the clip-board.\n",
    "For computer this area of information storage would be the **cache**.\n",
    "**Caches** are adjacent to the processors of the central- or graphical-processing-unit and keep the data that was used last.\n",
    "Due some technical reasons they can only copy a **page** at a time.\n",
    "A memory-**page** is simply a part of the **RAM**.  Imagine it like having a huge Newspaper size printout of a book. Now only one print-out fits on the desk at any-time, if you need a new one you have to get it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why do I mention **caches** at all? If you ever stumble about terms like *cache-coherence*, *cache-collision* or * cache-miss* you know have a rough idea what is happening.\n",
    "Also if you ever have to work with a lot of data you want to process fast,\n",
    "you may remember that you should try to keep all the data used in your calculation close to each other,\n",
    "to fasten things up.\n",
    "Do not overthink this however, because there are usually easier ways to make code run faster than to reorder your data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Back to out library image, so if the **RAM** is a small library what is the big library you have to take the bus to get to?\n",
    "It is usually the hard- or some external drive.\n",
    "It is very difficult to get data from there but it is large.\n",
    "Now some interesting quirk.\n",
    "Except the drives everything else gets wiped once the computer shuts down,\n",
    "just imagine flushing the entire building down the toilet and only leaving the university-library standing.\n",
    "In other words the drive is **permanent** storage and the rest is **non-permanent** storage."

    "#### File-system\n",
    "\n",
    "Now since we just learned that only the drive survives the computer shutdown, \n",
    "it becomes clear why people do not bother to much with organizing anything else.\n",
    "On the drives however we want to organize things, therefore we need a system a **file-system**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The duty of a **file-system** is to know where on a drive data in the form of **files** is stored and who is permitted to see or change them.\n",
    "This leads us to two essential concepts **folders** and **users**.\n",
    "A **folder** is something you put stuff in like a container.\n",
    "You can put everything into a **folder** especially other **folders**.\n",
    "This idea is quite universal and once you stop thinking of **folder**-icons on a desktop you will discover,\n",
    "that this concept reappears everywhere in computer science.\n",
    "Stuff that contains itself is a fundamental organizational structure which you will use later in this course in the form of ```list``` or ```dict```.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we discussed **folders** they make it easier to find stuff by limiting the what you or your program can see inside of them,\n",
    "to ensure you do not see what you are not supposed to see, like password-hashes or personal information we use **users**.\n",
    "A **user** is essentially like a key for a lock.\n",
    "Once you have entered you password and authenticated yourself you are handed the keys of that **user**.\n",
    "So you can log in as “YourName”, but also as “GenericPrinterUser”.\n",
    "The first one can access your personal files the second one can use the printer. \n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure **users** have only access to the things they are supposed to use we use permissions and ownership.\n",
    "So the research-data may be owned by “YourPostDoc”, but you have permission to **read** them.\n",
    "This becomes relevant if you attempt to **write** into them,\n",
    "because then the operating-system will ask the **file-system** if you have **permission** and then politely tell you that you can not do that,\n",
    "so you stand in front of a locked door.\n",
    "Also known as “Help, my program does not write any output into the folder,\n",
    "but it does in another.” Please remember this it will save you a day and potentially a rather embarrassing moment in your future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good so now we know there are **users** and **permissions**,\n",
    "but that all sounds rather difficult and people do not want to use a password every-time they want to use the printer,\n",
    "instead we use user-groups.\n",
    "User-groups are simply lists with users in them and all the users get the permission the group has.\n",
    "This is cumulative so if you in the “writeData”-group and in the “readData”-group you can both read and write.\n",
    "So know you know what IT is on about, when they talk about **permissions** and **users**."
