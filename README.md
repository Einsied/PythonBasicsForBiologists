# Python basics for biologists

Thie repositry contains a number of jupyter notebooks that are meant as supplementary material to an introduction course into Python.
The target audience are biology students with little or know previous experience with Python or a similar programming language.
The focus of the course will be more on the abstract concepts than on the language itself.

## Access materials

While the materials can be cloned onto a local machine and jupyter can be installed there,
this process is suprisingly cumbersome and frustrating for beginners,
therefore the materials aer hosted on [mybinder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/Einsied/PythonBasicsForBiologists/main).
