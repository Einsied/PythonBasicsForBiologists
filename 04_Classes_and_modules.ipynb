    "## Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last unit you learned how to use **functions** to structure your code. **functions** usually take **arguments** as inputs. Programmers learnt that most **functions** are very closely associated with a set of **arguments**.  So they concluded that these arguments should be bundled in [structures]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language) and associated with their **functions**. This lead to **classes** and the emergence of [object-oriented-programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).\n",
    "\n",
    "Object oriented programming tries to understand the world as a limited set of abstract ideas. It tries to simplify, by finding a set of shared attributes and behaviors. Alice for example decided to describe all her cells by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- their ID\n",
    "- the position of the nucleus\n",
    "- the area of the nucleus\n",
    "- the center area of the cell\n",
    "- the cell area\n",
    "\n",
    "So she defined herself a \"cell\" **class**. \n",
    "The objects belonging to or the **instances** of this **class**  are the entries in the csv-file she gave Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before classes are a combination of **functions** and **values**. So we could add a **function** to this cell-**class** if we want, like calculating the difference between nucleus and total cell-area. This **function** belonging to the class would then be called a **method**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few **methods** that should always exist. If we do not write them Python will create some dummy method instead. A **method** that almost every class will have is the constructor, that transfers the **values** into the object / **instance**. In Python it is called ```__init__```.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a **class** we begin with the keyword ```class``` followed by its name and ```:```. We then begin listing its attributes like the **methods**. So we write a **function** called ```__init__```. The first argument of every **method** in Python has to be the **instance** of the **class** itself, therefore it is usually named ```self```, then the other **arguments** follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us put this into code:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Define the class with the name \"Cell\"\n",
    "class Cell:\n",
    "    # Write the constructor with all the arguments we need to store our attributes\n",
    "    def __init__(self, identification, position_nucleus, area_nucleus, center_cell_area, cell_area):\n",
    "        # I use to name the attributes in the cell like the arguments to avoid confusion\n",
    "        # You may as well named them differently and write:\n",
    "        # self.id = identification\n",
    "        self.identification = identification\n",
    "        self.position_nucleus = position_nucleus\n",
    "        self.area_nucleus = area_nucleus\n",
    "        self.center_cell_area = center_cell_area\n",
    "        self.cell_area = cell_area\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This snippet defines the **class**, but does not create an **instance**. The computer knows what cell is, but it does not know any specific cell. To create a specific cell we have to create an **instance**. In our case, we will create an **instance** called ```cell1```:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "cell_1_id = 1\n",
    "cell_1_position_nucleus = (45, 74)\n",
    "cell_1_nucleus_area = 65\n",
    "cell_1_area = 231\n",
    "cell_1_center_of_area = (49, 71)\n",
    "cell_1 = Cell(cell_1_id, cell_1_position_nucleus, cell_1_nucleus_area,  cell_1_center_of_area, cell_1_area)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we no wish to gain the area of the cell we can access the attribute or member by following up the name of our **instance** with ```.``` and the name of the member:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "cell_1_area = cell_1.cell_area\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach become useful if we deal with a large number of **instances**, in our case a few hundred cells for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you know how classes are generally used. Let us start with a few exercises.  First create write your own Cell **class** and add a method to calculate the ratio between nucleus area and cell area. To access the attributes in the class use ```self```. If you are stuck at this exercise try to search for inspiration on the internet."

    "### Type hinting\n",
    "\n",
    "Python attempts to hide **types** from us, by using a method called [duck-typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing). Duck-typing is named after the [duck-test]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test):\n",
    "\n",
    ">\tIf it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give a concrete example if it can be used with ```+```, ```-```,```/``` and ```*``` it is probably a number. So python does not care if something is an **int** or an **float** as long as they behave the same. This concept can then be expanded to other **types** like **list** or **tuple**. So if all your **function** does is access an argument like ```argument[3]``` it does not matter if it is a **list** or a **tuple**.  This behavior is often useful, because **functions** can work on **types** they were not designed for, but there are dangers. Consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "test_list = [\"Test A\", \"Test B\", \"Test C\"]\n",
    "index_b = 1\n",
    "index_c = 4 / 2\n",
    "print(test_list[index_b])\n",
    "print(test_list[index_c])\n",
    "```\n",

So ```test_list[0]``` gave us the first element of the **tuple**, which was the **list**. I hope you can see how such a typo might be missed and cause problems later, without raising an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this problem we have two tools at our disposal. The first one is additional documentation in the form of [type-hints]( https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html), these permit us to communicate the intended **type**. The final users may still feed other stuff into it, but they now have to option to supply the **type** we had in mind when we wrote the code. \n",
    "\n",
    "For type hinting we add the **type** of an argument behind it separated by ```:```. The return **type** is written at the end of a **function**/**method** after ```->```. If nothing is returned the return **type** is ```None```, so we write ```-> None```. We can only use **classes** that are fully defined, so a class can not hint at itself, for this reason the return of ```__init__``` is not hinted. In our example this also applies for the ```distance```-method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of type-hinting demonstrated on our point-class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "class Point:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, x:int | float, y:int | float):\n",
    "        self.x = x\n",
    "        self.y = y\n",
    "    def distance(self, other_point) -> float:\n",
    "        distance = ((self.x - other_point.x) ** 2 + (self.y - other_point.y) ** 2) * (1/2)\n",
    "        return distance\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, this is the polite way for people that read documentation. Considering that, I often work with my own code I do not need to be polite and I do not read the documentation of something I wrote just a few weeks before I use a different method for my code. Since I know what inputs I expect, I check for them and raise an error if the **type** is not expected. This approach permits me to fail early and fix the problem at its source instead of searching for it for hours. I assume you will find similar uses of ```type``` and ```isinstance``` in a few code-bases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two **functions** ```type``` and ```isinstance``` allow us to investigate the **type** of an object. So if we wish to get the **type** of a variable ```a``` we write ```type(a)```.  Here is a short example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "a = 2.3\n",
    "type_of_a = type(a)\n",
    "print(type_of_a)\n",

    "\n",
    "If we wish to reuse it, we have two options first, our metabolic center-**class** could contain a point, just like our ```Cell```-**class** contained two **instances** of the ```Point```-**class**, one for the center of the nucleus and one for the center of the cell. This is called [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition) and represents a “has a”-relationship, as in “a cell *has* a center of its area.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The second option is [inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)), representing an “is a”-relationship, as in “a ```MetabolicCenter``` *is* a ```Point```”. Since the metabolic center *is* a ```Point``` it *inherits* all members (like **methods**) from its *parent*-**class**. So if the ```Point```-class has a ```distance```-method so has our ```MetabolicCenter```. This means every **function**/**method** that uses ```Point``` can also use ```MetabolicCenter``` instead.

A similar **method** is ```__repr__```, it should return a **str**, which can be used to reconstruct the object. All of them start and end with two ```_```. Let us add and use ```__repr__``` as an example:\n",

    "\n",
    "Modules are organizational units for code quite similar to classes.

This means you usually have to install them in the command line with a command like ```pip install numpy```, which installs [numpy](https://numpy.org/), Numpy is used for most calculations in Python, because it acts as an interface to Fortran, C and C++ libraries, which due to compile-time-optimization and other design features run much faster than pure Python can.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we do wish to only import a part of the module and not all of it, in this case we use ```from``` infront of ```import```. We can then directly access the imported object. So our code-snippet would then look like this:\n",
