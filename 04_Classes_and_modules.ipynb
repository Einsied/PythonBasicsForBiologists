    "## Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last unit you learned how to use **functions** to structure your code. **functions** usually take **arguments** as inputs. Programmers learnt that most **functions** are very closely associated with a set of **arguments**.  So they concluded that these arguments should be bundled in [structures]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language) and associated with their **functions**. This lead to **classes** and the emergence of [object-oriented-programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).\n",
    "\n",
    "Object oriented programming tries to understand the world as a limited set of abstract ideas. It tries to simplify, by finding a set of shared attributes and behaviors. Alice for example decided to describe all her cells by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- their ID\n",
    "- the position of the nucleus\n",
    "- the area of the nucleus\n",
    "- the center area of the cell\n",
    "- the cell area\n",
    "\n",
    "So she defined herself a \"cell\" **class**. \n",
    "The objects belonging to or the **instances** of this **class**  are the entries in the csv-file she gave Bob.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before classes are a combination of **functions** and **values**. So we could add a **function** to this cell-**class** if we want, like calculating the difference between nucleus and total cell-area. This **function** belonging to the class would then be called a **method**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few **methods** that should always exist. If we do not write them Python will create some dummy method instead. A **method** that almost every class will have is the constructor, that transfers the **values** into the object / **instance**. In Python it is called ```__init__```.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a **class** we begin with the keyword ```class``` followed by its name and ```:```. We then begin listing its attributes like the **methods**. So we write a **function** called ```__init__```. The first argument of every **method** in Python has to be the **instance** of the **class** itself, therefore it is usually named ```self```, then the other **arguments** follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us put this into code:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Define the class with the name \"Cell\"\n",
    "class Cell:\n",
    "    # Write the constructor with all the arguments we need to store our attributes\n",
    "    def __init__(self, identification, position_nucleus, area_nucleus, center_cell_area, cell_area):\n",
    "        # I use to name the attributes in the cell like the arguments to avoid confusion\n",
    "        # You may as well named them differently and write:\n",
    "        # self.id = identification\n",
    "        self.identification = identification\n",
    "        self.position_nucleus = position_nucleus\n",
    "        self.area_nucleus = area_nucleus\n",
    "        self.center_cell_area = center_cell_area\n",
    "        self.cell_area = cell_area\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This snippet defines the **class**, but does not create an **instance**. The computer knows what cell is, but it does not know any specific cell. To create a specific cell we have to create an **instance**. In our case, we will create an **instance** called ```cell1```:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "cell_1_id = 1\n",
    "cell_1_position_nucleus = (45, 74)\n",
    "cell_1_nucleus_area = 65\n",
    "cell_1_area = 231\n",
    "cell_1_center_of_area = (49, 71)\n",
    "cell_1 = Cell(cell_1_id, cell_1_position_nucleus, cell_1_nucleus_area,  cell_1_center_of_area, cell_1_area)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we no wish to gain the area of the cell we can access the attribute or member by following up the name of our **instance** with ```.``` and the name of the member:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "cell_1_area = cell_1.cell_area\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach become useful if we deal with a large number of **instances**, in our case a few hundred cells for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you know how classes are generally used. Let us start with a few exercises.  First create write your own Cell **class** and add a method to calculate the ratio between nucleus area and cell area. To access the attributes in the class use ```self```. If you are stuck at this exercise try to search for inspiration on the internet."
