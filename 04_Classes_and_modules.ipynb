    "## Classes\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last unit you learned how to use **functions** to structure your code.\n",
    "**functions** usually take **arguments** as inputs.\n",
    "Programmers learnt that most **functions** are very closely associated with a set of **arguments**. \n",
    "So they concluded that these arguments should be bundled in [structures]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struct_(C_programming_language) and associated with their **functions**.\n",
    "This lead to **classes** and the emergence of [object-oriented-programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).\n",
    "\n",
    "Object oriented programming tries to understand the world as a limited set of abstract ideas.\n",
    "It tries to simplify, by finding a set of shared attributes and behaviors.\n",
    "The original data for example decided to describe all the spikes by:\n",
    "\n",
    "- their rat ID\n",
    "- their unit ID\n",
    "- their channel\n",
    "- the time they occured\n",
    "\n",
    "So they defined a \"spike\" **class**. \n",
    "The objects belonging to or the **instances** of this **class**  are the entries in the csv-file we saw.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned before classes are a combination of **functions** and **values**.\n",
    "So we could add a **function** to this spike-**class** if we want, like calculating getting the rounded down spike time.\n",
    "This **function** belonging to the class would then be called a **method**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few **methods** that should always exist.\n",
    "If we do not write them Python will create some dummy method instead.\n",
    "A **method** that almost every class will have is the constructor, that transfers the **values** into the object / **instance**.\n",
    "In Python it is called ```__init__```.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a **class** we begin with the keyword ```class``` followed by its name and ```:```.\n",
    "We then begin listing its attributes like the **methods**.\n",
    "So we write a **function** called ```__init__```.\n",
    "The first argument of every **method** in Python has to be the **instance** of the **class** itself,\n",
    "therefore it is usually named ```self```, then the other **arguments** follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us put this into code:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "# Define the class with the name \"Cell\"\n",
    "class Spike:\n",
    "    # Write the constructor with all the arguments we need to store our attributes\n",
    "    def __init__(self, rat_id, unit_id, channel, spike_time):\n",
    "        # I use to name the attributes in the cell like the arguments to avoid confusion\n",
    "        # You may as well named them differently and write:\n",
    "        # self.rat_id = rat_identification\n",
    "        self.rat_id = rat_id\n",
    "        self.unit_id = unit_id\n",
    "        self.channel = channel\n",
    "        self.spike_time = spike_time\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This snippet defines the **class**, but does not create an **instance**.\n",
    "The computer knows what spike is, but it does not know any specific spike.\n",
    "To create a specific spike we have to create an **instance**.\n",
    "In our case, we will create an **instance** called ```spike1```:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "spike_1_rat_id = 1\n",
    "spike_1_unit_id = 0\n",
    "spike_1_channel = 2\n",
    "spike_1_spike_time = 0.5725\n",
    "spike_1 = Spike(spike_1_rat_id, spike_1_unit_id, spike_1_channel,  spike_1_spike_time)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we no wish to gain the time of the spike we can access the attribute or member by following up the name of our **instance** with ```.``` and the name of the member:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "spike_1_spike_time = spike_1.spike_time\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach become useful if we deal with a large number of **instances**, in our case a few hundred spikes for example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you know how classes are generally used. Let us start with a few exercises.\n",
    "First create write your own Spike **class** and add a method to get the rounded down spike time.\n",
    "To access the attributes in the class use ```self```.\n",
    "If you are stuck at this exercise try to search for inspiration on the internet."

    "\n",
    "Python attempts to hide **types** from us, by using a method called [duck-typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing).\n",
    "Duck-typing is named after the [duck-test]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test):\n",
    "\n",
    ">\tIf it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.\n",
    "\n",
    "To give a concrete example if it can be used with ```+```, ```-```,```/``` and ```*``` it is probably a number.\n",
    "So python does not care if something is an **int** or an **float** as long as they behave the same.\n",
    "This concept can then be expanded to other **types** like **list** or **tuple**.\n",
    "So if all your **function** does is access an argument like ```argument[3]``` it does not matter if it is a **list** or a **tuple**.\n",
    "This behavior is often useful, because **functions** can work on **types** they were not designed for, but there are dangers.\n",
    "Consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "test_list = [\"Test A\", \"Test B\", \"Test C\"]\n",
    "index_b = 1\n",

    "and do not read the documentation of something I wrote just a few weeks ago,\n",
    "I use a different method for my code.\n",
    "Since I know what inputs I expect, I check for them and raise an error if the **type** is not expected.\n",

    "### Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us assume we wish to track the rats temperature in addition to our spikes.\n",
    "We now need a class that is a spike and has a temperature.\n",
    "We could now rewrite the ```Spike``` class with all its methods for that or we could reuse it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we wish to reuse it, we have two options first,\n",
    "our temperature-spike-**class** could contain a spike.\n",
    "This is called [composition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_composition) and represents a “has a”-relationship,\n",
    "as in “a temperature-spike *has* a spike.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The second option is [inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)),\n",
    "representing an “is a”-relationship, as in “a ```TemperatureSpike``` *is* a ```spike```”.\n",
    "Since the ```TemperatureSpike``` *is* a ```Spike``` it *inherits* all members (like **methods**) from its *parent*-**class**.\n",
    "So if the ```Spike```-class has a ```rounded_down_spike_time```-method so has our ```TemperatureSpike```.\n",
    "This means every **function**/**method** that uses ```Spike``` can also use ```TemperatureSpike``` instead.\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "class Spike:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, rat_id, unit_id, channel, spike_time):\n",
    "        self.rat_id = rat_id\n",
    "        self.unit_id = unit_id\n",
    "        self.channel = channel\n",
    "        self.spike_time = spike_time\n",
    "    def rounded_down_spike_time(self) -> int:\n",
    "        return int(self.spike_time)\n",
    "\n",
    "class TemperatureSpike(Spike):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, rat_id, unit_id, channel, spike_time, temperature):\n",
    "        # super permits us to access the parent-class\n",
    "        super().__init__(rat_id, unit_id, channel, spike_time)\n",

    "\n",
    "temperature_spike = TemperatureSpike(1, 0, 2, 1.2, 38.2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe your temperature-spike is also a pressure measurement.\n",
    "So ```TemperatureSpike``` *is* a ```Spike``` and it is a ```PressureMeasurement```,\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope you can see that this permits you to split complex systems in small easy to understand parts.\n",
    "You can achieve similar benefits with composition, but you then have to access the specific part every time,\n",
    "which can gets cumbersome after a few steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a powerful tool and therefore dangerous.\n",
    "I expect you will not need in it in your immediate future.\n",
