# Course description

## Purpose

Python a [popular](https://github.blog/news-insights/octoverse/octoverse-2024/) and rather easy to programming language.
The continuing transition of work and life into more digital spaces turns computer-literacy into a key-competence to achieve personal and career goals in research and industry.
Students should acquire fundamental computer-science knowledge as soon as possible, which is the purpose of this course.

## Goal

Students will be enabled to create their own short programs and to study Python or other programming languages on their own in the future.

## Description 

The course teaches basic programming in Python.
The focus are theoretical foundations, problem-solving strategies and differences between "biological" and "computer-science" approaches to problems.
The course will introduce concepts and the language itself by utilizing a single example.
The participants and the tutor interactively develop the solution to the problem presented in the example.
The example problem is the visualization and limited statistical analysis of a measurement data distributed over multiple files.

## Examination

The participation in the course and the final result will be used to grade the participants.
