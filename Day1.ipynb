    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a Turing complete scripting language, this means it is a very useful tool to solve problems with logical algorithms. Simpler said it tells your computer how to crunch data or do computations for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are reading this you are most likely a biology student and wish to analyze a few data.\n",
    "This is what I intend to teach you here. In my personal experience the adoption of  programming languages is not hindered by the amount of “How to code”- literature. The internet is full of different sources that teach you how to code, what they do not teach you is how to think like the people that created the languages or tools you are using. This matters for **you** especially,\n",
    "because your training as a biologists differs in some fundamental aspects from that of mathematicians, computer-scientists and physicists. These differences in training enable you to understand and investigate biological processes in a way that I could never, but they also hinder you in developing and utilizing *code*. For this reason I will focus more on the way of thinking than on syntax and libraries. Once you have understood the fundamental concepts you should be able to close the gaps using the [official documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/) and [tutorial[(https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me begin by quoting the first paragraph from the [official tutorial[(https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "I assume this paragraph did not teach you much, which can be attributed to two gaps in your knowledge. The first gap is your vocabulary or your knowledge of definitions. This is knowledge that you can easily acquire by consulting textbooks or Wikipedia. I attempted to mark the terms that are stronger influenced by this here:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python is an easy to learn, powerful *programming language*. It has *efficient* *high-level* *data structures* and a simple but effective approach to *object-oriented* programming. Python’s elegant *syntax* and *dynamic typing*, together with its *interpreted* nature, make it an ideal language for *scripting* and rapid *application* development in many areas on most *platforms*.\n",
    "\n",
    "So understanding these terms is a hurdle, especially because most of the terms are suspiciously familiar, like *efficient* for example. I doubt however that you measure efficiency in *operations* and *memory* consumption. The term *efficient* in this paragraph should be understood in these terms however, but as mentioned before this is not the major challenge. Let me highlight a two more words for you:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a **simple** but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s **elegant** syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The terms here show the second gap in your knowledge, the way you approach, understand and interact with **problems**. Yes for you a problem is probably a hurdle, an inconvenience, an obstacle, for me it is the fundament of scientific study. For me sciences consists of **problems** and **solutions**, these fit together like puzzle-pieces enabling us to understand and control the world. Only if you have both a **problem** and a **solution** can you publish, if you publish an observation you publish something you believe will help someone else to **solve** a question. So this person has a question or **problem** and  you provide a **solution**. This question-answer-relationship is anchored rather deeply in computer-science, where you as the user want to achieve something, thereby defining a **problem** and then creating your **solution** based on the work of other software-developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "I chose the previous example to show you the rather alien of thinking. It may seem familiar to you now, but unless you studied a mathematic related subject previously I assure you it is not. To stress this point let us discuss **simple** and **elegant**. What do they mean here? I would claim they refer to a very mathematical concept of perfection, which we may embody by the sentence: “Say precisely enough”. This means everything that needs to be said is said and anything else is not. This is often achieved by very few strict and solid definitions. Python for example was initially lauded for its rather small number of [reserved terms](https://docs.python.org/3.13/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords) and [built-in functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html). It was considered **simple** and **elegant**, because it use **few** terms and combined them into a bigger system. It is **simple**, because it has **few** constituent parts and **elegant**, because they achieve the larger goal by their interaction. It is in the interaction of the objects, concepts and definitions that beauty can be found and is referred to here, but teaching a course on mathematic and logical aesthetics is beyond me so I will summarize with: It takes roughly 3 years to learn and you are fine hobbling along and ignoring it. What you can not ignore however is the way of thinking around it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me [quote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth) Donald Knuth a rather well known computer scientists on what makes a good programmer:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The psychological profiling [of a programmer] is mostly the ability to shift levels of abstraction, from low level to high level. To see something in the small and to see something in the large. \n",
    "\n",
    "What he refers to can be described as the ability to change perspective, to switch from a cellular few to the organ to the organism and to the entire ecosystem depending on the question asked and more importantly to stay quiet about the aspects that do not matter for the question. In other words to **say precisely enough**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way of thinking makes great engineers and physicists, as they are able to find the common characteristic for a brown bear, a moose and a sack of grain on the road. The all are an obstacle that slows down traffic. They all have a position on the road, which can be expressed by the distance along it. This information is sufficient to steer traffic away from it and therefore precisely enough for a road manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "The central mechanism they use to describe things are *equivalence*-classes. *Equivalence* means we can change entities in a context without anything changing. If some one is thirsty it does not matter if we hand them water or ice-tea, therefore water and ice tea are *equivalent* in the context of quenching thirst. Just like a 100 €-bill and a 10 €-bill are equivalent for buying one bag of flour. It does not matter which one you have it buys a bag of flour, at least until inflation ruins this example. An *equivalence*-class describes all things that are *equivalent* within a context. Since a brown bear, a moose and a sack of grain all block the road they are part of the same *equivalence*-class.\n",
    "\n",
    "So once it is clear what they share they also *decide* to perceive only the characteristics of things they deem relevant. So if something blocks the road they only need to know were to drive. Since the road is a long line they only need to know how far from the beginning of the road the obstacle is placed. The pitfall is already integrated in the example here: Removing a sack of grain and a living animal are two quite distinct tasks requiring distinct equipment. Note that they would not attempt to attach the nature of the obstacle to their description, but prefer to say something like “bear spray required for removal”, since while a bear always requires bear-spray there might be other obstacles that can be removed with bear-spray, so the “bear spray required for removal” is the larger *equivalence*-class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now you may wonder why you were trained to think different, then answer is quite simple. This way of thinking makes quite poor observers. If you hand them a piece of paper and tell them to observe a rat for 30 minutes there is a good chance they wrote five sentences: “Rat walked to the far end of the cage. Rat walked to the center of the cage. Rat ran around the cage. Rat walked back to far end of the cage. Rat walked around the cage.” You know that is is a not “precisely enough”, but they only will only know after you begin asking questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correct use is of abstraction is next to a few fundamental mathematical concepts used to abstract problems the difference between a capable and an incapable programmer. The difference between endless despair and flying levity, it is what I hope to demonstrate and teach you in this course."

    "\n",
    "After the philosophical part let us get an example so we know what we are talking about. Let us assume you have a friend Alice and a friend Bob. Alice is a computer-vision specialists, this means she can find things in images. Bob researches cancer. Bob is interested in the growth of cancer-cells, so he gets five Petri dishes and adds his cell culture and for twelve days he photographs them every day with a microscope. Assume it looks like this image from [wikipedia](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:384_microwell_plate_imaged_with_2.5_x_magnification_in_3_channels_with_ZEISS_Celldiscoverer_7_%2830614936632%29.jpg)\n",

    "\n",
    "Since counting all this cells would take a long time and also risks introducing human mistakes Bob asks Alice for help. Alice runs an computer-vision program over the images and creates a few comma-separated-values-files (.csv) as output, she then goes on vacation. Considering that he has no idea how to evaluate the files Alice sent him Bob approaches you to help him.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the goal of the course is to take a few comma-separated-values-files and create a few plots to learn something about the data they contain. To begin this process we will first talk about data, **variables**, **values** and **operators**. These are the fundamental building blocks of our code. Afterwards we will talk about **control-structures**, like **loops** and **conditional-instructions**. These allow us to react to our code and process an arbitrary amount of data. We then will talk about **functions**, **classes** and **modules**. These help us organize our code and ensure we only deal with the things we really need to think about. In the end we will use external modules to visualize and analyze the data. This is the final step that helps us answer Bobs questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the course is separated into five parts with separate content and goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Part | Content                     | Goal                                              |\n",

    "|    5 | External modules            | You visualized data and can now learn on your own |\n",

To achieve this you used your human experience and your ability to reason about the world to assume “He wants to drink the water later, so I have to ensure it is not spilled.”. Computers can not do this, because they have no human experience and can not reason like you. A **computer is a logical machine**, a predictable system.

Now imagine a large metal ball roughly 3 meter in size and place it on a slope. What will it do? It will roll down the hill, not sideways not upwards just down until it comes to rest. This is how computers reason. If they begin at a certain point in the landscape they always reach the same final solution the same final state. The commands you will give them decide where the hills and valleys are and the parameters where they start. This is why some people tell you, that instructions for a computer have to be very detailed, or in our analogy that the landscape has to very finely crafted with tiny valleys in the slopes a few centimeters wide. This is not correct. Instructions for computer **do not need to be detailed**, but **you have to know how the logic will flow** or in our mental image how the ball will roll.\n",

    "Neither your program nor your computer will deceive you, purposefully misunderstand your instructions or arbitrarily deviate, only humans have enough freedom in their thinking to do this. You may have the impression that your program or machine learning algorithm do these things, but they just follow their logical path, this means that the burden of fault lies entirely with us, that instruct the machines and in a few rare cases cosmic rays that might flip a bit. For this burden we gain control, it is our choice how the logical-flows of our programs are organized, how they react to their inputs. A small lab-rat may refuse to participate in an experiment or sabotage it, but today even our most powerful computer will do as instructed.\n",

To solve our **big problem** we need to break it up into smaller one. Then we look at the smaller one and repeat the process recursively until the solution is either obvious or someone already solved it. Most problems you encounter were already solved, unfortunately you do not know which ones, so choosing which problem to focus on is challenging. Considering I want to teach you something I will focus on the problem that is in my opinion the most educational at the moment."

So the memory of a computer is based on a cell that is either filled or empty, “true” or “false”. Everything is built from this cells. Your phone number, your program and the pictures on your phone are all saved in such cells. This is kind of a hassle, since it is difficult to figure out what which cell actually means.

If you recall your earlier education you should remember that the value of a number depends on the number and position of characters. So “19” means calculate 1*10 + 9*1. This becomes relevant because there are simpler system. If you wish to reduce the amount of characters to remember you can simply read “15” as 1*9 + 5*1. You can continue this process until you are left with two characters “1” and “0”. In theory you could reduce further but then you no longer have an elegant way to write larger numbers. Since this system has only two characters is called binary. Now if you paid attention the cells have two states, “filled” and “empty” and we have two numbers “1” and “0”, we can therefore use them to write binary numbers like “1001”, which translates to 1 * (2*2*2) + 0 * ( 2*2) + 0 * (2) + 1 * 1. \n",

    "So a computer saves numbers as binary numbers made up of ones and zeros. There is a wrinkle however. Since a computer is a real physical object int can only save a limited number of ones and zeros, so we have to squeeze multiple numbers in the same memory. How do we do this? Simple answer we write them behind each other and remember how long they are. It is convention to define the length of a power of 8. So we have numbers that are 8 cells, 16 cells, 32 cells or 64 cells long. There are also longer numbers but they are uncommon. There are advantages to choosing 8, like its proximity to 10 and the fact that 8 digits in binary correspond to two digits in hexadecimal numbers, but these are not relevant now.\n",

    "Considering that this was a lot of rather dense information I would suggest you take a break and let the new information settle. Maybe you have same questions that appear later and you would like to have answered. Let us attend to them before we dive deeper into the inner workings of a computer."
